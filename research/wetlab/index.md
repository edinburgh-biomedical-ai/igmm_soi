Currently, there is a lack of quantitative information regarding these molecular mechanisms in early oncogenesis. 
It is not clear whether every cell that acquires a known set of cancer mutations is predetermined to progress to become a cancer cell, or whether other necessary, but not on their own sufficient, genetic triggers or alterations are required for an already ‘genetically abnormal’ cell to become cancerous. 

We design well-controlled tractable cancer models as baseline to study the process of oncogenesis, in collaboration with [Luke Boulter's lab][2] at the [Institute of Genetics & Molecular Medicine][1] (IGMM)
