teaser: "One of the aims of biomedical genomics is to determine causal molecular interactions underlying biological processes. These interactions can be highly complex, involving many dependent variables constituting a given biological system of interest. Quantifying interactions, beyond extracting their magnitude, and moving towards obtaining information on their directionality (causality) requires well-designed experiments and/or large-scale individual-level biomedical data."
