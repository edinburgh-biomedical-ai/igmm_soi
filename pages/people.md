      <td><strong>Abel Jansma:</strong> PhD student, jointy supervised with <br/>  Chris Ponting (IGMM, primary supervisor) and <br/> Luigi Del Debbio (School of Physics)<br /><br /> In my research, I think about genetic interactions. We usually think about interactions between two genes, but what does an interaction between three genes look like? Do these higher-order interactions affect the behaviour of cells? I try to answer these questions by combining intuition from physics, knowledge from biology, and techniques from mathematics. </td>
